What’s on Netflix❓ Exploring Content Trends Over Time

## Overview:
This personal data analysis project explores content trends on Netflix using a dataset originally consisting of 8,807 rows and 12 features. The data spans from 2008 to 2021 and includes information such as content type (Movie or TV Show), title, director, country of origin, date added to Netflix, release year, rating (e.g., PG, TV-MA), and duration.
I used Microsoft Excel to clean and manipulate the data, analyze patterns, and build a dashboard that answers key questions about Netflix’s content library. The goal of this project was to practice exploratory data analysis and storytelling using visual tools while uncovering insights about the types of content Netflix adds over time.


## The main questions I explored include:
1.	How many titles are added per year? Are there spikes in certain years?
2.	Are older or newer titles being added more frequently?
3.	What percentage of Netflix’s content is Movies vs. TV Shows?
4.	Which countries are most represented on Netflix?
5.	Is Netflix adding more family-friendly or adult content over the years?


## Key Insights:
1.	Content Growth Over Time:
Between 2008 and 2021, the number of titles added to Netflix increased significantly starting in 2016, peaking in 2019 with 2,016 new additions. After 2019, the number of titles added each year began to decline.
2.	Preference for Newer Releases:
Since 2016, Netflix has consistently favored newer content (released after 2000) over older content (released before 2000).
3.	Movies vs. TV Shows:
Netflix’s content library is made up of approximately 70% movies and 30% TV shows, indicating a strong preference for movie content.
4.	Country Representation:
The United States is by far the most represented country on Netflix, with 3,240 titles, followed by Canada with 271 titles.
5.	Adult vs. Child Content:
Netflix's catalog leans heavily toward adult-oriented content. Approximately 77% of titles are rated for adults, while 23% are child- or family-friendly.
